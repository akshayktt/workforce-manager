## 🎯 Testing Checklist

Before sharing widely, test with one person:

- [ ] They scan your QR code
- [ ] App opens on their phone
- [ ] They can login
- [ ] They can navigate the app
- [ ] No errors appear

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Screenshot the QR code** - Easier to share than describing it
2. **Also send the text link** - In case QR doesn't work
3. **Test with close person first** - Before mass sharing
4. **Keep a terminal visible** - Monitor any errors while they use it
5. **Tell them about WiFi requirement** - Avoid confusion

## 🆘 If Something Goes Wrong

### QR Code doesn't appear
- Wait longer, sometimes takes 30 seconds
- Try: `npm start --clear`

### "Cannot connect to server"
- Check backend: `npm run server:dev` still running?
- Check IP: Run `ipconfig` again
- Check WiFi: Are you on same network?

### App crashes after opening
- Check server logs for errors
- Restart both servers
- Try clearing Expo cache: `npm start --clear`

### Different network access needed
- Install Ngrok: `https://ngrok.com/download`
- Run: `ngrok http 19000`
- Share the exp:// link it provides
